# Restorix CC Queue

> **The live task queue for CC (the builder).** Manager/Cowork chats (Eagle/Falcon) **append** prompt specs here; CC executes top to bottom, **deletes each item the moment it ships**, and writes the full record to [[Restorix Memories]]. An empty queue below means there is nothing for CC to do.
>
> **Why this is its own file** (added 2026-09-01 after a stale-clone incident): keeps ownership clean — manager chats own this file, CC owns [[Restorix LIVE_STATE]] + [[Restorix Memories]] — and keeps it small enough to read whole, append to, and re-read to verify in seconds. See vault-root `CLAUDE.md` → "Reaching Atlas safely".
>
> **Rules for whoever writes here:**
> - Write into the **connected local vault folder** `C:\Users\freem\obsidian-mind`, never a clone. Confirm it's attached first.
> - After writing, **re-read this file from disk** and confirm your text is present before telling Brayden it's queued.
> - **Numbering:** next prompt number = one past the highest referenced in [[Restorix LIVE_STATE]] + [[Restorix Memories]]. Don't reserve numbers anywhere but here.
> - One `## Prompt NNN — <title>` heading per item. Put the full spec inline (or in a `<details>` block). Order = execution order.

## Queue empty

Nothing for CC to do. Last cleared 2026-09-01 (Prompt 566 = verify 558 live → confirmed live, no build needed). Manager/Cowork chats: append the next `## Prompt NNN` here.
