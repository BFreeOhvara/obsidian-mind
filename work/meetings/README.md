# Meeting Notes Inbox

Drop exported or raw meeting notes here. Run `/om-intake` to process all files — it reads each one, classifies the content, and routes everything to the correct vault locations:

- Project updates → relevant `work/active/` note
- Decisions → `brain/LIVE_STATE.md` Open Threads / Problems & Resolutions
- Wins → `brain/Memories.md` session log
- Action items → relevant work notes

**This folder is a staging area, not storage.** Once a note is processed, `/om-intake` will ask to delete the raw export.

## Naming Convention

Drop files as-is from your export tool. Suggested prefix for clarity:

```
YYYY-MM-DD <Topic or Person>.md
```
