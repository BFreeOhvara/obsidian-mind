# Ohvara CC Queue

> **The live task queue for CC (the builder), Ohvara side.** Manager/Cowork chats (Eagle/Falcon) **append** prompt specs here; CC executes top to bottom, **deletes each item the moment it ships**, and writes the full record to [[Memories]]. An empty queue below means there is nothing for CC to do — check [[North Star]]'s Current Focus instead.
>
> **Why this is its own file** (added 2026-09-30, mirroring [[Restorix CC Queue]]'s own fix from 2026-09-01): keeps ownership clean — manager chats own this file, CC owns [[LIVE_STATE]] + [[Memories]] — and keeps it small enough to read whole, append to, and re-read to verify in seconds. Also closes a real gap Brayden hit the same day: Ohvara's queue used to live inside a "Next Up for CC" section of the combined [[LIVE_STATE]] file, and saying "run the next Ohvara task" had no file name of its own to point at the way "run the next Restorix task" does — genuinely easy to get confused with, or for a queued item to get lost in unrelated edits to the same shared file. Splitting it out gives Ohvara the same unambiguous queue file Restorix already had.
>
> **Rules for whoever writes here:**
> - Write into the **connected local vault folder** `C:\Users\freem\obsidian-mind`, never a clone. Confirm it's attached first.
> - After writing, **re-read this file from disk** and confirm your text is present before telling Brayden it's queued.
> - **CC: re-read this file from disk immediately before any write that removes a completed item — not just once at session start.** This file gets appended to by manager chats *while CC is still mid-task*, so a stale in-memory copy from session start can silently revert a newly-queued item when CC's own ship-sweep writes back "item shipped, remove it." This has already happened twice (Prompts 683 and 686 both vanished this way, had to be manually re-added after Brayden caught CC saying it couldn't find the next task). Re-reading right before every write that modifies this file — not just the first read of a session — is the actual fix.
> - **Numbering:** next prompt number = one past the highest referenced anywhere in the vault — the counter is shared across Ohvara AND Restorix. Check [[LIVE_STATE]] + [[Memories]] AND [[Restorix LIVE_STATE]] + [[Restorix Memories]] + [[Restorix CC Queue]] before assigning a number.
> - One `## Prompt NNN — <title>` heading per item. Put the full spec inline. Order = execution order.
> - **Committing this file:** CC's Ohvara session has standing `git add`/`commit`/`push` permission as of 2026-10-01 (added after the Prompt 664 blocker), so CC's own next ship sweeps up and commits whatever's sitting here uncommitted — a manager chat queuing an item does **not** need to separately commit/push it by hand. (Historical note: this rule originally asked for an immediate manual commit, after an uncommitted queue edit got wiped on 2026-09-30 — the real cause turned out to be the device-bridge connection itself dropping mid-write, not uncommitted git state, and a manual commit wouldn't have protected against that anyway. The re-read-to-verify rule above is the real safeguard.)

## Prompt 673 — Agent billing: $350/week flat retainer via Stripe

> **✅ E2E PASSED IN TEST MODE 2026-10-02 (CC).** Subscribe (4242) → webhook → `active`, Manage billing → portal, cancel → `canceled` (access through Oct 9), renew → `active`. Detail: [[Memories]] 2026-10-02 "P673 e2e". **Not yet exercised:** a failed *renewal* (`past_due` + 48h grace). It needs a renewal to come due (Test Agent's renews Oct 9) or a Stripe test clock. **Remaining CC work waits on Brayden's go-ahead:** live key, flip `agent_billing_enforced`, mark test accounts exempt. Until then, CC skips this item.

> **✅ FULLY UNBLOCKED 2026-10-02 — Brayden created the Stripe webhook endpoint (sandbox) and confirmed `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set in Supabase secrets.** Both `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are now in place. **CC: run the end-to-end test (card 4242 + a declining card) per [[LIVE_STATE]] step 4, confirm the webhook actually fires and updates `billing_status`, then report back — going live (real key, enforcement on) still needs Brayden's explicit go-ahead, don't flip that on your own.**

> **✅ UNBLOCKED 2026-10-02 — Brayden confirmed `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set in Supabase secrets** (sandbox/test key, `sk_test_...`, from a Stripe Sandbox under the existing Ohvara Stripe account — the account itself is a leftover from a pre-pivot AI-agency idea and currently unused for anything live, but the sandbox keeps this build fully isolated from it regardless). Scaffolding already shipped (`8bcb971`, mig 113): schema, Settings → Billing tab, admin column and the access gate, with enforcement off. **CC: resume this item — build the Stripe edge functions + webhook now that the secret is in place.** A second secret, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, will be needed once the webhook endpoint exists — flag that back to Brayden/Eagle when you reach that point rather than guessing a value.

**Hard prerequisite, blocks everything past schema/UI scaffolding — same category as Prompt 393 (Daily.co) and Prompt 666 (Twilio): CC cannot create third-party accounts.** Brayden needs a Stripe account (confirm whether one already exists before assuming it doesn't) and real API keys handed over as Supabase secrets before billing logic can be built. If not available when CC picks this up, stop at that point, build what's ready, and flag blocked exactly like 393/666 — don't guess at a workaround.

**Business model, Brayden's own framing — direction of money matters, this is NOT agent commissions:** agents pay **Ohvara** (not the reverse) a flat recurring retainer — $350/week per agent — for portal access and that week's batch of client cancellations to be worked. If they want the service again the following week, they pay $350 again. This is a weekly recurring subscription gating portal access, not a one-time charge and not a payout to agents.

**Don't confuse this with, or build on top of, the old dead Payouts system.** `ohvara_legacy_setter_pipeline_dead.md` confirms `Payouts.jsx` / `/admin/payouts` already exists in the codebase from the pre-pivot model — it paid "reps" **via Stripe** against the old `commission_payouts`/`appointments`/`leads` tables, which are emptied and unused. That page is unreachable from nav but still present. This new prompt is the opposite direction of money flow and a different Stripe integration (Billing/Subscriptions, not payouts) — don't revive or extend the old page/tables; this is a fresh build, though the fact Stripe was integrated before may mean an existing Stripe account/connection to check on, worth asking Brayden about directly rather than assuming a clean slate.

**Technical shape (real latitude, Opus's call):** Stripe Billing/Subscriptions with a weekly recurring price; a webhook handler for payment success/failure that flips a `billing_status` (new column, migration needed — flag it) on `profiles`, gating portal access when unpaid; an agent-facing billing view (Settings is the obvious place) showing current status and next charge date, using Stripe-hosted Checkout/Customer Portal rather than a custom card form to stay out of PCI scope. Admin-side visibility for Brayden into who's current/who's lapsed.

**Not yet decided, Opus's call once building:** grace-period behavior on a failed payment (immediate access cutoff vs. some buffer) and exactly what "access paused" looks like in the UI (locked overlay vs. read-only) — document the decision and why in the ship note.

**Log in the ship note:** whether a Stripe account/keys were present and usable (and whether it's the same account as the old dead Payouts integration or a new one), the exact migration applied, and — if blocked — exactly what Brayden needs to go create, mirroring how Prompt 393/666's blockers are written.

## Prompt 696 — No-answer recovery: text → text → one locked retry call → confirm number → morning+evening text next day → hand off to the agent

> **✅ BUILT 2026-10-04 (CC, `95c04b0`, migration 122) — everything up to the SMS blocker.** Texting is OFF (`recovery_config.sms_live = false`), so no lead enters the flow yet. **Remaining, waits on Brayden:** an SMS-capable Twilio number registered for A2P 10DLC, then flip "Texting live" in Settings → Text follow-up (admin card; it also shows whether the configured number is SMS-capable). Until then, CC skips this item. Detail: [[Memories]] 2026-10-04 "P696".

**Blocked on a real external step, same category as Stripe/Twilio-voice (Prompts 393/666/673): needs an SMS-capable Twilio number registered for A2P 10DLC before any SMS actually sends.** CC should build everything up to that point and stop there, flagged exactly like those — don't guess at a workaround.

**Sixth and final pass — supersedes the version just before this one in this file. Brayden confirmed this is the last open piece of the design.** Only change from the prior pass is pinning down exact Phase 2 timing.

**Phase 1 — the locked retry day (unchanged):**

1. Original booked call ends in **No answer.** Immediately, a text fires (agent must have the opt-in toggle on, per this prompt's first pass): acknowledges the missed call, says a retry is already locked for the same time tomorrow, gives the self-serve reschedule link (with an "ASAP" option, not just specific times). **If the client uses that link to pick a new date/time, the lead flips straight back to Booked — done, no further steps.**
2. At that same moment, the next-day retry slot is reserved for real in the actual assignment/booking system (Prompt 684's logic) — **must block double-booking.**
3. If no response by the next morning (~9:00–9:30 AM local, configurable): a second text fires, same reschedule link, reminding them of today's scheduled retry.
4. If still no reply: the locked retry call happens at the original time.
   - Resolves → Cancelled, done.
   - No answer again → stays status **No answer**. Full cap on Phase 1: one retry day, two texts, two calls total — not an open loop.

**Checkpoint: pause everything, require the agent to confirm the number.** After the second no-answer, stop all automated texting and stop auto-booking any further retry calls. The lead surfaces with an explicit "Confirm this is the right number for this client" action. Nothing further runs until the agent does that — and the agent can do this at any time of day, which is what this pass pins down.

**Phase 2 — post-confirmation, exactly one day, two texts, then hand off (this is the piece that changed):**

- The agent can confirm the number at any time of day — don't fire anything the moment they confirm. **Wait for the next fresh calendar day after confirmation**, then:
  - A **morning text** (~9:00–9:30 AM local, same default as Phase 1's reminder time), same reschedule link.
  - An **evening text** later that same day (default ~6:00–7:00 PM local — real latitude on the exact hour, Opus's/CC's call, just make it configurable rather than hardcoded) — same reschedule link.
- **If there's no response to either of those two texts by end of that day, the agent gets notified to call the client themselves and try to rebook.** This is the full and final cap on Phase 2 — exactly one day, two texts, no calendar slot reserved at any point in this phase, then a clean handoff to a human. Automation for this lead ends there.

**Surfacing, not a new status:** keep the attempt/phase visible on the No-answer badge wherever it shows (My Pipeline, Needs Attention) — e.g. "No answer · retry tomorrow," "No answer · needs number check," "No answer · follow-up (AM sent)," "No answer · follow-up (PM sent)," "No answer · call agent directly."

**What CC should build now, up to the blocker:**
- The Settings opt-in toggle (unchanged, default off, one-time consent).
- Per-lead attempt tracking: phase (1 or 2), both Phase-1 texts' sent/responded state, the retry call outcome, confirmed-number flag + timestamp, Phase-2's AM/PM text sent/responded state.
- Text 1 (immediate) + the self-serve reschedule link with specific-time and ASAP options, parsed only through that link flow — not freeform reply parsing.
- The real, slot-blocking next-day retry booking — reuse Prompt 684's assignment/slot logic, must prevent double-booking.
- Text 2 (next-morning reminder, ~9 AM default, configurable).
- The hard pause + "confirm the number" agent action after the second no-answer — confirmable at any time, doesn't trigger anything until the next calendar day.
- Phase 2: the next-day AM + PM texts, same reschedule-link mechanism, no calendar slot reserved.
- The final handoff notification to the agent ("call this client yourself and rebook") once both Phase 2 texts are exhausted with no resolution — this ends the automated flow for that lead.
- **Stop at:** a real SMS-capable Twilio number + completed A2P 10DLC registration. Check first whether the existing `CALLER_ID_TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` is already SMS-capable before assuming a second number is needed. Flag exactly what Brayden needs to go do, mirroring how Prompt 393/666/673's blockers are written, and build/verify everything that doesn't depend on it in the meantime.

Scope note: still layers on top of Prompt 695's No answer status/color/layout work, which stands as-is — this prompt is the automated recovery behavior running underneath that same status.

## Prompt 712 — Billing page: Premium cap 14→16 submissions/week, plan-card copy says "max of N submissions a week"

Brayden reviewed the live Billing page (`/agent/billing`, screenshot: Standard $350/wk · 7 submissions a week, Premium $500/wk · 14 submissions a week, currently the active plan).

**1. Raise Premium's weekly submission cap from 14 to 16.** Find the actual source of truth for this limit (plan config/constant, DB column, wherever the enforcement check reads it — not just the display string) and change it there, so the real cap enforced on booking actually becomes 16, not just the number shown on the card. Standard's cap stays 7 — unchanged.

**2. Reword both plan cards' submission line to make clear the number is a hard cap**, e.g. "max of 7 submissions a week" / "max of 16 submissions a week" (Brayden's own phrasing — exact wording is fine to match the page's existing tone, but it must read as a maximum, not just a flat count).

**3. Verify "Submissions this week — X of Y used" on the same page reads off the same single source of truth you changed in step 1**, so Premium shows "of 16" automatically once the cap is updated — don't hardcode 16 separately there if it's meant to derive from the plan's cap value. Flag in the ship note if this count is in fact a separate hardcoded value somewhere and had to be updated by hand.

Scope note: Billing page only — cap value + copy wording. Don't touch Stripe price IDs/amounts ($350/$500 stay the same), just the submission-count cap and its label.

## Prompt 713 — URGENT/SECURITY: commission_schedule table is publicly readable+writable, enable RLS with a real policy

**Priority: do this one first, ahead of anything else in the queue.** Supabase's own security advisor (confirmed independently by Eagle via the Supabase MCP tools, not just the alert email) flags `public.commission_schedule` on the `ohvara-dashboard` project (ref `jjextitmbptoaolacocs`) as ERROR-level: RLS is disabled on this table, meaning right now, live, anyone with the project URL can read and write all 2,860 rows over the REST API with zero authentication. No login needed to pull or tamper with the company's full carrier/product/tier commission-rate data.

**Table shape:** `commission_schedule(id bigint pk, carrier text, type text, product text, tier integer, pct numeric)`. No owner/agent column — this is a shared global reference table (commission rates by carrier/product/tier), not per-user data. It's read by `compute_policy_estimated_commission()`, which is a `SECURITY DEFINER` function — so it runs with elevated privileges and will keep working regardless of what RLS policy you put on the table; you do not need to special-case that function.

**Fix: enable RLS on this table and add an actual policy, don't just flip RLS on and leave it default-deny.** Suggested shape, adjust if the app's real access pattern differs:
- `SELECT`: allow `authenticated` role (any logged-in agent/admin can see commission rates — reasonable since it's internal reference data, not secret-per-agent). Do NOT allow `anon`.
- `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`: admin-only (match however admin-gating is already done elsewhere in this schema — there's an existing `is_admin()` helper function, reuse it rather than inventing a new check).

Verify after: re-run the Supabase security advisor (or `get_advisors` type `security`) and confirm the `rls_disabled_in_public` finding for `commission_schedule` is gone, and manually confirm an anonymous/unauthenticated request can no longer read or write the table.

**Not in scope for this item, but flag in the ship note for a possible follow-up prompt:** the same advisor scan also surfaced ~20 functions with a mutable `search_path` and ~77 `SECURITY DEFINER` functions callable by `anon`/`authenticated` that were likely not all audited for whether that's intentional, plus leaked-password-protection being off in Auth settings. None of those are the live data-exposure emergency this prompt addresses — don't scope-creep into fixing them here, just note in the ship note that a broader security-advisor cleanup pass may be worth queuing separately.
